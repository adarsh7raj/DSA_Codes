// Intuition

// When deleting a node in a Binary Search Tree (BST), we must ensure the BST property remains valid after deletion. The BST property is:

// For every node, values in the left subtree are smaller, and values in the right subtree are larger.

// So, deletion needs to be handled carefully depending on how many children the target node has.

// Steps:

// Search for the node to delete
// Traverse the tree while keeping track of the parent pointer. If the key doesn‚Äôt exist, simply return the root.

// Case 1: Node has no children (leaf node)

// Just remove the node by updating the parent‚Äôs pointer to nullptr.

// If the node is the root, the tree becomes empty.

// Case 2: Node has one child

// Replace the node with its single child.

// Update the parent‚Äôs pointer accordingly.

// If the node is the root, the child becomes the new root.

// Case 3: Node has two children

// This is the tricky part. We need to find a replacement that keeps the BST valid.

// We can choose either:

// Inorder Predecessor (the maximum value in the left subtree)

// Inorder Successor (the minimum value in the right subtree)

// Your code chooses the inorder predecessor.

// Process:

// Copy the predecessor‚Äôs value into the current node.

// Delete the predecessor node (which will have at most one child).

// This way, the BST property is preserved in all cases.

// üìù Algorithm

// Find the node:

// Start from the root.

// Traverse left or right based on whether key < curr->val or key > curr->val.

// Keep track of the parent pointer.

// If the node is not found, return root.

// Delete node cases:

// Case 1 (No children):

// If curr is a leaf, set parent‚Äôs left/right = nullptr.

// If deleting root, set root = nullptr.

// Case 2 (One child):

// Find the child (curr->left or curr->right).

// Replace curr with its child in the parent‚Äôs pointer.

// If deleting root, update root to child.

// Case 3 (Two children):

// Find inorder predecessor = max node in curr->left.

// Start at curr->left and go as far right as possible.

// Copy predecessor‚Äôs value into curr.

// Delete the predecessor node (which has at most one child).

// Return root after deletion.
